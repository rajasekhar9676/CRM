2. Fill in these **EXACT** settings:
   - **Name**: `products` (must be exactly this)
   - **Public**: ✅ **CHECK THIS BOX** (very important!)
   - **File size limit**: `10` (MB)
   - **Allowed MIME types**: `image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif`

## 🔍 If You Don't See "Storage" Option

If you don't see Storage in the left sidebar:
1. Make sure you're in the correct project
2. Check if you have the right permissions
3. Try refreshing the page

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Solution**: Make sure the bucket is set to **Public** ✅

### Issue: "File too large"
**Solution**: Check that file size limit is set to `10` MB

### Issue: "Invalid file type"
**Solution**: Verify MIME types include: `image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif`

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After creating the bucket, you should see:
- [ ] Bucket named "products" in your Storage → Buckets list
- [ ] Bucket shows as "Public"
- [ ] File size limit shows "10 MB"
- [ ] Image upload works in your app

## 🎯 Expected Result

Once the bucket is created:
- ✅ Product image uploads will work
- ✅ Images will be stored at: `products/{userId}/{timestamp}.{ext}`
- ✅ Images will display in product lists and detail views
- ✅ No more "Bucket not found" errors

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If you're still getting errors after creating the bucket:
1. **Wait 30 seconds** - sometimes it takes a moment to propagate
2. **Refresh your app** - hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Check browser console** - look for any new error messages
4. **Verify bucket settings** - make sure it's public and has the right MIME types

The storage bucket creation is the ONLY thing preventing image uploads from working. Once created, everything will work perfectly!
